# Mises Improvement Proposal (MIP)

This is a location to record all high-level architecture decisions in the Mises.


## Rationale

MIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new feature designs and new processes, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions.
An MIP should provide:

- Context on the relevant goals and the current state
- Proposed changes to achieve the goals
- Summary of pros and cons
- References
- Changelog

Note the distinction between an MIP and a spec. The MIP provides the context, intuition, reasoning, and
justification for a change in architecture, or for the architecture of something
new. The spec is much more compressed and streamlined summary of everything as
it stands today.

If recorded decisions turned out to be lacking, convene a discussion, record the new decisions here, and then modify the code to match.

## Creating new MIP

Read about the [PROCESS](./PROCESS.md).

#### Use RFC 2119 Keywords

When writing MIPs, follow the same best practices for writing RFCs. When writing RFCs, key words are used to signify the requirements in the specification. These words are often capitalized: "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL. They are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).
